Implementation of SE-NDT laser odometry, presented in "Integrating deep semantic segmentation into 3D point cloud registration", Robotics and Automation Letters, Oct. 2018

This version uses PointNet++ instead of PointNet, and is integrated with ROS. The model is pretrained for use with HDL64.
Pointcloud segmentation and registration are done in realtime for HDL-64 at 10Hz.

Dependencies: Eigen, PCL, Tensorflow(only if pointnet is used), ROS (if integration is required).

To use:

git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/azaganidis/se_ndt
mkdir se_ndt/build
cd se_ndt/build
cmake ..
make -j4
./ros_register 

On a new terminal:

cd se_ndt/pointnet2/deploy/build
cmake ..
./deploy
